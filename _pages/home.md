Hi! I am Dingyi Pan, but I usually go by Penny. 


I am an incoming Ph.D. student in linguistics at UC San Diego. 

My research focuses on psycholinguistcs and pragmatics. I use both computational modeling and psycholinguistic experiments to probe how people comprehend and produce sentences and make inferences in a given context.


Prior to my study at UCSD, I completed my B.A. in Cognitive Science with a correlate (minor) in Computer Science at Vassar College, where I was advised by [Janet Andrews](https://www.vassar.edu/faculty/andrewsj). Then, I travelled across the coast to Stanford University and completed my M.S. in Symbolic Systems. During my time at Stanford, I was affiliated with the [ALPS lab](http://alpslab.stanford.edu/) and advised by [Judith Degen](https://thegricean.github.io/). I publish under my Chinese name.
