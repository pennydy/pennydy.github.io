Hi! I am Dingyi Pan (潘丁依), but I usually go by Penny. I am an incoming PhD student in linguistics at UC San Diego. Prior to my study at UCSD, I completed my B.A. in Cognitive Science with a correlate (minor) in Computer Science at Vassar College and my M.S. in Symbolic Systems at Stanford University. I publish under my Chinese name.

I am broadly interested in how human comprehend sentences and make inferences, specifically in the domain of psycholinguistcs and pragmatics.

At Vassar, I was advised by Janet Andrews in the Cognitive Science Department, and my undergraudate thesis focused on bilingual lexical access. 
At Stanford, I was affilated with the ALPS lab advised by Judith Degen in the Linguistics Department, working on projection inferences.
