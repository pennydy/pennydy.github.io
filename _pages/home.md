Hi! I am Dingyi Pan, but I usually go by Penny. I am an incoming PhD student in linguistics at UC San Diego. Prior to my study at UCSD, I completed my B.A. in Cognitive Science with a correlate (minor) in Computer Science at Vassar College, where I was advised by [Janet Andrews](https://www.vassar.edu/faculty/andrewsj). Then, I travelled across the coast to Stanford University and completed my M.S.in Symbolic Systems. During my time at Stanford, I was affilated with the [ALPS lab](http://alpslab.stanford.edu/) advised by [Judith Degen](https://thegricean.github.io/) in the Linguistics Department, working on projection inferences. I publish under my Chinese name.


I am broadly interested in how human comprehend sentences and make inferences, specifically in the domain of psycholinguistcs and pragmatics.
